This application generates a random password, allowing users to select from the following criteria: 

	- length of password (between 8 and 128 characters) 
	- uppercase characters
	- lowercase characters
	- numeric characters 
	- special characters 

The user preference is determined via a series of prompts (with at least one selection of character type required). After all prompts are answered, the password is then generated.
